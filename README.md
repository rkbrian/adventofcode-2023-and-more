# Advent of Code

🎄 This is my personal project for solving problems from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about).

🎅 Each folder contains the solution set for a specific year, which can generate the correct answers based on the given inputs.

🎁 The solutions are written in multiple programming languages rather than focusing on just one.
